# Verification tool for CME Active Regions

CatView (Catalogue View) was built to visualise and parse through a catalogue relating CME events (between 2010-2019) and their associated source regions in the solar surface.

The application can be downloaded from the releases page in this repository or can alternatively be built from source. To build from source you can clone the repository and run `npm install` to download all necessary packages. If building from scratch please contact me via email so I can send you the csv file for the catalogue.

This application was built using electron-js, it uses the catalogue developed by Julio Hernandez Camero and combines it with flare and dimming data obtained from [Solar Demon](https://www.sidc.be/solardemon/) and SHARP active region videos.
